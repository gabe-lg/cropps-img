## Instructions
Run `run.cmd`. The first time you execute it, `setup.cmd` will run
automatically to configure the environment and install required
dependencies. It will _not_ run again after the initial execution. To force a
new setup at any time, use `run_force_setup.cmd`.

Upon success, you will be prompted to enter arguments. For default behavior,
press return. For the list of available options, enter `-h`.

_Tip_: Avoid repeatedly typing arguments using the following syntax:
```commandline
echo "<options>" | .\run.cmd 
```

## Instructions
Run `run.cmd`. The first time you execute it, `setup.cmd` runs automatically
to configure the environment and install required dependencies. It does _not_
run again after the initial execution. To force a new setup at any time, use
`run_force_setup.cmd`.

Upon successful setup, you will be prompted to enter arguments. For default
behavior, press return. For the list of available options, enter `-h`, or
run `./run.cmd -h`.

_Tip_: Avoid repeatedly typing arguments using the following syntax:
```commandline
./run.cmd <options>
```
